<a name="nodejs"></a>
## Node.js (required) 
This is the only required software.  These are [NodeBots](http://nodebots.io) so they require [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) to run. Node is a JavaScript runtime based on the V8 engine.  It is how you will be running the code today.  Just download and install it.

- [OSX](http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.33/node-v0.10.33.pkg)
- [Windows 32bit](http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.33/node-v0.10.33-x86.msi)
- [Windows 64bit](http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.33/x64/node-v0.10.33-x64.msi)

<a name="arduino"></a>
## Arduino IDE (required for Windows)
The Arduino IDE is useful if you want to run native C code with your Arduino boards.  In this lab, we will be using JavaScript on a host computer which communicates over serial to the Arduino.  We've pre-loaded the required code on your board, so you don't need the Arduino IDE for much.  It does, however, install some necessary drivers for USB to Serial in Windows.  You might want it, also, if you want to do more advanced things with your hardware.  After you install it, run it once.

- [OSX](http://arduino.cc/download.php?f=/arduino-1.0.6-macosx.zip)
- [Windows](http://arduino.cc/download.php?f=/arduino-1.0.6-windows.exe)

<a name="git"></a>
## Git (recommended)
The open source community runs on [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](http://github.com).  All of our examples as well as anything else you are likely to want to bring in will be on Git.  Because of this, we recommend that you have Git.  You can get away with not installing it if you prefer -- you can just download Zip files from GitHub -- so it is optional.  If you don't already have Git installed, we recommend installing the GitHub client on Windows.  For the Mac, open up a command line and type `git --version`.  If it is already installed, you will get a version back.  If not, OSX will ask you to install the necessary components automatically.

<a name="vs"></a>
## Visual Studio Tools for Node.js (optional for Windows)
Some Windows users prefer the Visual Studio environment when developing in Node.  If you think you'd like to do that, you can install the tools for Visual Studio 2012 or 2013

- [VS 2012](http://nodejstools.codeplex.com/downloads/get/946896)
- [VS 2013](http://nodejstools.codeplex.com/downloads/get/946895)

<a name="sublime"></a>
## Sublime Text (optional)
You need a text editor.  Chances are that you already have one that you like.  If not, try Sublime Text.  It is pretty nice.

- [OSX](http://c758482.r82.cf2.rackcdn.com/Sublime%20Text%202.0.2.dmg)
- [Windows 32bit](http://c758482.r82.cf2.rackcdn.com/Sublime%20Text%202.0.2%20Setup.exe)
- [Windows 64bit](http://c758482.r82.cf2.rackcdn.com/Sublime%20Text%202.0.2%20x64%20Setup.exe)
