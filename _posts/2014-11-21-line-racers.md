If you are feeling more like a pacifist and you don't want to fight your bot, then perhaps you would like to race your bot?  Your line racer will follow a dark line on a white background and will traverse the path as quickly as possible.  You will be given a "reflectance sensor kit" which can be used to detect your position on the line.  

**Here are the rules:**

0. You may use any materials you wish to build your bot.
0. You will be timed as you traverse the track once.
0. A 6" perpendicular line will indicate the start/finish line (same spot).  Your sensor will start on this line and your bot must stop on the line.  Failure to stop will result in a 6 second penalty.
0. Your line sensor must stay on the line at all times.  Failure to do so will result in a 2 second penalty for each divergence. The referee reserves the right to disqualify any both which flagrantly diverges from the course.
0. The minimum turn radius will be 2 inches.
0. There is at least 3 inches between the edge of the line and the edge of the platform or other line.
0. Bots which take more than 1 minute to complete will be disqualified.
