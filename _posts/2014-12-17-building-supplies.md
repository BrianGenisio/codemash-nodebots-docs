We have a lot of building supplies that you can use to build your ideas.  For a full list, see your [Lab Inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1snX36J_Z5fDnIDeg48gQlfwQUidzGE4iUPnsUCTJoA8/edit#gid=62263519).  Some tools that are particularly interesting:

## Wood
We have all sorts of wood to build with.  Much of it comes in small pieces of balsa, or dowel rods.  We also have extra wooden wheels and platforms.

## Foam Board
Foam board is great for prototyping.  It is relatively strong, and easy to cut.  We have foam board in all shapes and sizes.

## Acrylic Sheets
Also known as Plexi-Glass, acrylic sheets are very strong.  Consider cutting acrylic sheets with the "scoring tool" or the rotary tool.

## Glue, Tape, Staples, Velcro, Magnets, Zip Ties
We have lots of different kinds of adhesives.  Rubber cement, Elmers Glue, Crazy Glue, Single-sided tape, Double-sided tape, Electrical tape, Staples, Velcro, Magnets, Zip Ties (lots of them), and more. 

## Random Hardware
We have a lot of assorted random nuts, bolts, screws, etc.  

## Plasti Dip
Plasti-Dip is a paintable goo that dries as plastic.  It is useful for adding grip to any surface.  It does take a while to dry, but the heat gun helps accelerate that process.
