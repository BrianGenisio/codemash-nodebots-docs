Perhaps you don't want to compete with anyone.  That is totally fine!  You can just hack.  Come up with an idea, and go to town.  We have a fully-stocked lab with all sorts of chassis, building materials, controller boards, electronic components, and tools.  Checkout out inventory for more information about what we have for you to build with.  Build whatever you want.  Just make sure to "show and tell" at the end.  We can't wait to see what you build.
