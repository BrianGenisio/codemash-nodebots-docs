We have several "experimental" platforms that you can play with.  You may wish to use these instead of the supplied wood.  They are first-come, first-serve.

## Omnibot

The Omnibot is cool because it can move in any direction at any time with its three omni-dirctional wheels.  You'll need a motor controller and have to figure out the vector math to make it work, but the possibilities are pretty cool.  We have three of these to hack with.

## Magician's Chassis

The Magician's Chassis is a beefed up version of the basic kit we are supplying you with.  The key differences is that it has more ways to mount things and it runs off of gearmotors instead of servos (though you can probably hook servos up instead).  You'll need a motor controller to power this thing, but they are EASY to use.  We have three of these to hack with.

## Tank

We have a tank!  It is made of metal and has tank treads.  Pretty cool!  It runs off of motors, so you will need a motor controller of some sort.

## Gearboxes and Wheels

We have a couple of configurable gearboxes for extra power.  They come with some basic wheels.  You will need a motor controller to drive these motors.

## Sumobot Jr

The Sumobot Jr is a neat little chassis.  It uses continuous servos and packs a lot into a small amount of space.  We have one of these.

## Dune Buggy Car

The Dune Buggy Car will need some creative steering applied to it, but it is a spritely little chassis.  With two different gear ratios, this thing can go fast!  You will need a motor controller to drive this motor.

## Pan/Tilt Platform

We have a pan/tilt platform controlled by micro servos.  We aren't sure what you will do with this, but that's up to you!
