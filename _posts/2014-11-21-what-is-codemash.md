[CodeMash](http://codemash.org) is a really great regional software conference in the Midwest.  CodeMash is home to some of the greatest technical polyglot content in the country.  Sporting over 2000 attendees, and hosted at an [indoor waterpark](http://www.kalahariresorts.com/ohio) in the dead of the winter, CodeMash has become a favorite technical conference for us all.

The conference, held over four days in January, is broken up into two "pre-compiler" days and two regular session days.  The "pre-compilers" feature half-day and full-day hands-on sessions.  This is when the NodeBots event will be held -- both days with different sets of hackers each day.
