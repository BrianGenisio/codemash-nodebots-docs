# Website for [NodeBots.CodeMash.org](http://nodebots.codemash.org)

This site uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and GitHub Pages to host.  **Pull Requests are accepted!**  If it is just a small Markdown change, you can go into the "_posts" folder right from GitHub to edit and create an automatic fork/PR without cloning the repo onto your machine.  If you want to do more, install Jekyll, clone the repo, and run `jekyll serve --watch` from the "gh-pages" branch.
