This site uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and GitHub Pages to host.  **Pull Requests are accepted!**  If it is just a small Markdown change, you can go into the "_posts" folder right from GitHub to edit and create an automatic fork/PR without cloning the repo onto your machine.  If you want to do more, install Jekyll, clone the repo, and run `jekyll serve --watch` from the "gh-pages" branch.

**Note**: This is the site for Nodebots @Codemash 2015.  For the 2016 event, please see [the NodeBots Unleashed site.](https://github.com/CareEvolution/nodebots-unleashed-codemash-docs)
