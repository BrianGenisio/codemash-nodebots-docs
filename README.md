This is a place to find information about Nodebots at [CodeMash](http://codemash.org) 2015.  Here, you will find several examples and it is where the [documentation site](http://nodebots.codemash.org) is hosted (see the `gh-pages` branch for documentation).

## To run the examples: 

```js
node examples/strobe.js
```

* Replace `strobe.js` with whatever example you want to run.
