## Welcome to CodeMash NodeBots!

**[SAVE YOUR SEAT!  Supplies are limited!](http://www.codemash.org/save-seat2/)**

Armed with an Arduino, MacGyver-like circuitry, cheap wood, and JavaScript, can you rise to the call of battle? Engage your brain by building in three dimensions: software, electronics, and hardware. Innovate to give your bot the edge over your competition and battle for NodeBot supremacy. This precompiler is an all-day, hands-on, immersive experience. You don’t need to have any Node.js, hardware, or electronics experience — there will be coaches and pairs to work with you! Whose NodeBot will reign supreme?

Feeling more like a pacifist? Compete in our Line Racer challenge instead. Don’t feel like competing? We’ll have all sorts of platforms, boards, components, supplies, etc for hacking robots however you want.
