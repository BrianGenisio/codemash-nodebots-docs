The bot kit was all packaged into a gallon ziplok bag.  The wood was cut in bulk using a wood shop.  
The wheels were cut with a drill press and a 2.5" hole saw.  

The links below are where I purchased everything from.  Except for the servos.

The servos were purchased in bulk from a dude on eBay for $6.50 each.  I had to contact him off-auction but he gave
me the deal.  I suggest making sure the email is a valid eBay address and the PayPal invoice accurately describes
what you are getting (to ensure PayPal protection) if you make a deal like this.
